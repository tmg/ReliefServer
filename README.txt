Compiling recompose2
====================

- Install openFrameworks 0071
- Install the following addons under openFrameworks/addons:
    ofxKinect (tag 007)
  (The other addons are standard, apart from a (patched) version 
  of ofxManyMouse so that it works with openFrameworks 0071 -- 
  that addon is included under src/).
- Put recompose2 in openFrameworks/apps/<yourfolder>/
- Open and build/run with XCode 4.
